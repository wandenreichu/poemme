            In the quiet of the night,
            Words dance in the moonlight,
            Like fireflies in the dark,
            Each one leaving its mark.

            They whisper secrets old,
            Stories waiting to be told,
            In the rhythm of the heart,
            Where poetry finds its start.

            Like stars in the sky above,
            Each word is filled with love,
            Creating magic in the air,
            A moment beyond compare.
